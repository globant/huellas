Huellas iOS Swift project

This project uses Cocoa Pods to include external libraries. To work in Xcode, use .xcworkspace file always. 
If you want to add a new library, modify .podfile file and then run "pod install" while you are in the terminal. 

For troubleshooting run pod setup first and then pod install.

To install Cocoa Pods use $ sudo gem install cocoapods or go to http://cocoapods.org/ for more information. 

Current project includes Facebook-iOS-SDK, RestKit, googleplus-ios-sdk, Google-Maps-iOS-SDK and Parse SDK.
